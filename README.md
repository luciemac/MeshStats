# Mesh Statistics


## What is it?
Mesh Statistics is a module developed for 3D Slicer to quantify 3D surfaces for Image Processing.
Its goal is to compute simple statistics on a 3D model, considering specifics regions (defined previously) or the entire surface.
Statistics computed are: minimum value, maximum value, average, standard deviation, and different type of percentile. These statistics are based on the output generated by an other module: ModelToModelDistance.
